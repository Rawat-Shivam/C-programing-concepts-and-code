The STL includes classes that overload the function call operator. Instances of such classes are called function objects or functors. Functors allow the working of the associated function to be customized with the help of parameters to be passed.

Consider a function that takes only one argument. However, while calling this function we have a lot more information that we would like to pass to this function, but we cannot as it accepts only one parameter. What can be done?

One obvious answer might be global variables. However, good coding practices do not advocate the use of global variables and say they must be used only when there is no other alternative

Functors are objects that can be treated as though they are a function or function pointer. Functors are most commonly used along with STLs
