random header in C++ | Set 1(Generators)
This header introduces random number generation facilities. This library allows to produce random numbers using combinations of generators and distributions.

Generators: Objects that generate uniformly distributed numbers.
Distributions: Objects that transform sequences of numbers generated by a generator into sequences of numbers that follow a specific random variable distribution, such as uniform, Normal or Binomial.
