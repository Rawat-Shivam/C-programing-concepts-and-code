__builtin_inf() functions of GCC compiler
These fuctions do not need to include any header file to use them. So it provides faster usage, as these are Built-in functions of GCC compiler which is most used compiler, even in competitive programming.

Note: If the compiler shows warning of overflow, use casting before __builtin_inf() function as

(data_type)__builtin_inf()





Builtin functions of GCC compiler
These are four important built-in functions in GCC compiler:

_builtin_popcount(x): This function is used to count the number of one’s(set bits) in an integer.
Example:
if x = 4
binary value of 4 is 100
Output: No of ones is 1.
// C program to illustrate _builtin_popcount(x) 
  
#include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
    int n = 5; 
      
    printf("Count of 1s in binary of %d is %d ", 
           n, __builtin_popcount(n)); 
    return 0; 
} 
Output:
Count of 1s in binary of 5 is 2

Note: Similarly you can use __builtin_popcountl(x) & __builtin_popcountll(x) for long and long long data types.



_builtin_parity(x): This function is used to check the parity of a number. This function returns true(1) if the number has odd parity else it returns false(0) for even parity.
Example:
if x = 7
7 has odd no. of 1's in its binary(111).
Output: Parity of 7 is 1 
// C program to illustrate _builtin_parity(x) 
  
#include <stdio.h> 
int main() 
{ 
    int n = 7; 
      
    printf("Parity of %d is %d ", 
           n, __builtin_parity(n)); 
    return 0; 
} 
Output:
Parity of 7 is 1

Note: Similarly you can use __builtin_parityl(x) & __builtin_parityll(x) for long and long long data types.



__builtin_clz(x): This function is used to count the leading zeros of the integer. Note : clz = count leading zero’s
Example: It counts number of zeros before the first occurrence of one(set bit).
a = 16
Binary form of 16 is 00000000 00000000 00000000 00010000
Output: 27


__builtin_ctz(x): This function is used to count the trailing zeros of the given integer. Note : ctz = count trailing zeros.
Example: Count no of zeros from last to first occurrence of one(set bit).
a = 16
Binary form of 16 is 00000000 00000000 00000000 00010000
Output: ctz = 4
