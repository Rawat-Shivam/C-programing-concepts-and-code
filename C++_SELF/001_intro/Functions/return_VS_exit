When exit(0) is used to exit from program, destructors for locally scoped non-static objects are not called. But destructors are called if return 0 is used.

Calling destructors is sometimes important, for example, if destructor has code to release resources like closing files.

Note that static objects will be cleaned up even if we call exit()

if return :: constructor and destructor called

if exit:: constructor only called
	{ if static object(static class_name class_obj) :: destructor also called
