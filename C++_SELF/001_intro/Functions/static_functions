In C++, a static member function of a class cannot be virtual.
Also, static member function cannot be const and volatile. 
In C++, virtual functions can be private and can be overridden by the derived class.
static members are only declared in class declaration, not defined. They must be explicitly defined outside the class using scope resolution operator.
