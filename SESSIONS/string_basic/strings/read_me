taking string in the char arry throught cin>> will take upto the first space
but it may take more than the size of array and may lead to segmentation fault

2)
this overflow can be avoided by using setw() 
cin>>setw(MAX)>>str;

3)
if u declare a const size string and u are trying to assign it more than its capacity ...therefore errrooorrrr

4)
cin.get(str,max);
this will take string less than one of the size of the  string including spaces

5)
cin.get(str,MAX,'$');
it will atke input one less than size including spaces but till the '$' symbol(delimiter)
nd if delimiter nor encoutered ..then till size-1

6)
can copy uisng for(;strlen(s);) loop or by using strcpy(d,s);
